# ML Heart Disease Predictor

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and more, including ensemble methods like stacking, to improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) with 303 samples and 14 features.

### Columns:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (1 to 4)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- ...
